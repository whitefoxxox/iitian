GB SIR IS ONE OF THE BEST TEACHER IN INDIA OF MATHEMATICS AND ACCORDING TO ME HE IS SECOND BEST FACULTY OF MATHEMATICS IN INDIA AFTER MOHIT TYAGI SIR , HE IS ALSO FROM MOTION COACHING CENTRE. AS MATHEMATICS IS IS NOT LOVED BY MUCH STUDENTS BUT I PROMISE THAT AFTER STUDYING FROM HIM YOU WILL FELL IN LOVE WITH MATHEMATICS . HE WILL MAKE MATHEMATICS CKE WALK FOR YOU HE EXPLAIN EACH AND EVERY QUESTION WITH A GREAT INTREST AND WITH FUNNY DIALOGUE('BUT WITH A STRICT BEHAVIOUR NOT WITH A FUN WAY'). NOW AFTER COVID-19 HE ALSO STARTED TEACHING IN BYJUS. BUT I THINK DON'T FOLLOW HIS BYJUS LECTURES BECAUSE IN THOSE ONLINE LECTURES SIR HAD NOT TEACHED THAT MUCH GOOD. IF YOU WANT TO STUDY FROM G.B SIR SO YOU CAN FOLLOW HIS PAID ETOOS LECTURES('YOU CAN GET THEM IN FREE IN TELEGRAM') OR YOU CAN FOLLOW HIS BYJUS LECTURES('NOT RECOMMENDED BY ME') BUT FOR OFFLINE STUDY YOU CAN JOIN MOTION COACHING CENTRE KOTA
